Titrator solves aqueous chemical equilibrium problems, allowing the user to simulate complex biochemical, geochemical or environmental systems and to perform 'in silico' titration experiments.  Titrator is intended primarily for teaching purposes, and suggested simulation exercises are available (Educator's Guide), along with a user manual in English and in Spanish.

Teachers and students may download the compiled code, documents and examples through the 'downloads' tab.  The program is free, and should run on any Windows computer. Users are encouraged to send bug reports and suggestions for improvements by email to the project team.  We also ask that teachers who use the software let us know by email; we would be glad to include contributed exercises in the Educators Guide.

Programmers interested in improving the code should be aware that Titrator-Delphi is the predecessor of the Titrator project (also on Google code) which is being written in Java to allow cross-platform portability.  Titrator-Delphi runs only on Windows and requires a Delphi 6 compiler (commercial).  The Pascal source code is posted here, but you may wish to consider contributing to the Java project instead (which is intended to have a more intuitive interface and several 'bells and whistles' not found in the current Delphi version).
