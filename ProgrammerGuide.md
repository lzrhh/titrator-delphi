# Programmers Guide #

Titrator is written in [Delphi Pascal](http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi), the successor langugage of Turbo Pascal, currently owned and supported by  [Embarcadero Technologies](http://www.embarcadero.com).  You will require a copy of this (commercial) compiler to work on the Titrator-Delphi code, and you may prefer to work on the [Java version of Titrator](http://code.google.com/p/titrator/) instead.
